# Description
The Credit Card Payment Default Predictive Model project focuses on building a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card user is likely to default on their payment. By utilizing historical credit card transaction data and relevant attributes, the project aims to assist credit card issuers and financial institutions in identifying high-risk customers, enabling them to take proactive measures to manage credit risk effectively.  The model will be developed using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. These algorithms will analyze the historical transaction data and customer attributes to predict the likelihood of credit card payment defaults.  The project will follow several essential steps, starting with data collection, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify correlations with payment defaults. The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation. The most suitable machine learning algorithm will be selected based on performance metrics and interpretability.  The selected model will undergo training on the training dataset, learning patterns from past credit card default instances. The model's performance will be evaluated on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize the model's performance.  Interpreting the model's predictions will provide insights into the factors influencing credit card payment defaults. The final trained predictive model will be deployed to make real-time predictions on new credit card transactions, helping credit card issuers proactively identify high-risk customers and implement necessary actions to mitigate potential losses.  Overall, the Credit Card Payment Default Predictive Model aims to enhance credit risk management for financial institutions, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to minimize defaults and maintain a stable credit portfolio.
